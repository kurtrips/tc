Requirement for Change Password, Register and Help are currently left to Final Fix.
See http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=801954&start=0 and http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=801924&start=0


The Register logic in the code currently is incorrect and must be changed as required. See assembly spec 2.9


All changes required to the REST API are marked in GREEN in the WCF RESTful Endpoint.doc


I plan to have Login, Register, Forgot Password, Help and the Registration related fix as one assembly and the rest as another assembly.
However as a majority part of the first assembly is left to FF, I have included only one assembly in my current submission.
If I win, I will split it into 2 assemblies as described above.


A simple POC has been included to demo backbone.
