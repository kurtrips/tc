4. Notification SD - changed Scheduler Job to NotificationPusherJob



/////////////////FINAL FIX 1//////////////////////////

nikolay83 1.1.1.1 - The link in section 1.3.4 already points to the RijndaelManaged class doc.

nikolay83 1.1.1.2 - Added a line in 1.3.5 with an example from msdn.

nikolay83 1.1.1.3 - This is already met.

nikolay83 1.1.1.4, BLE 1.1.1 and DanLazar 1.1.1 - 
Remember Me option is now completely done at client side. See last paragraph of ADS 1.3.4. 
Also updated application_didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, LoginViewController.loginButtonClicked and BaseViewController.logoutClicked. 
Removed the relevant session maintenance code at server side.

nikolay83 1.1.2.1 and BLE 1.1.2.1 - Added a new lifeline at start of SD for session maintenance

nikolay83 1.1.2.2 - Added the SD

DanLazar 1.1.2.1 - Added the SD

BLE 1.1.2.2 - 
Not fixing this. 
Configuration SD is usually required when there is considerable configuration logic in a constructor or some other method. 
However here configuration is scattered i.e. AD configuration will only be needed when we connect to AD, APN configuration will only be needed when we send notification. 
So it is not all in one place.
So all I can show in SD is just 2 lifelines, one is 'calling code' and other is 'configuration file'. This is too simple an SD to be required. 

nikolay83 1.1.4.1 - Added classes to class diagram.

nikolay83 1.2.3.1 - Recommended item not fixed.

nikolay83 1.2.4.1 - 
This is met using the client authentication using digital certificates. 
Only clients with the expected digital certificate (installed by client) will be able to make call to teh service. 
See ADS 1.3.4.1 for more details.
