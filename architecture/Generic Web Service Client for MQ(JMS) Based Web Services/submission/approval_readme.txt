The design has been completely changed to use JAX-RPC instead of SAAJ and JMS.
All issues identified in Ravi_Comments.doc have been corrected. Some are obviously no longer valid because we are not using SAAJ and JMS anymore.

As I said before, JAX-RPC is a good option only for simple web service calls. Please be prepared for some mighty tedious debugging when you develop this .
