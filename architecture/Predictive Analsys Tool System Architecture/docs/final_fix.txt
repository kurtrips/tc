>>Please address the last client forum confirmations.

Done. Only memcached and Spring approval is still left


>>The user interface definition, the frontend module scope, is incomplete in my opinion........The gap is too large.

Added. See Front-End spec section 2.1
Also see the various back-end methods added in the backend spec.
Also, see example.doc for an example of teh usage.

>>Please look at "4.4.25 Read geographical contract data" it's marked as not needed for now.
>>But I think you need take that into account and made appropriate changes in API and data model during this contest because it causes huge changes in the future.

This can be easily modeled by adding a parameter called userGeocode to the parameterTypes:List<UserInputValueType> of the defineQuery method. The geocode can then be passed in the queryParameters parameters of the  DataAccess.getDataForAlgorithm method.


>>The homepage requirement should include viewing algorithm updates, testing what if scenario and the managing configured algorithm.

The homepage shows latest prediction results amd the list of algorithms. Both of these are now covered in section 5.2 of SDS


>>It is not clear how what if scenarios are represented in the frontend.

The input for an algorithm is an instance of the AlgorithmInput class. 
It consists of the initial setting values, the estimation values and the fact data. 
It is used to denote both an original input and a what-if case. 
In the what-if case, the AlgorithmInput.isWhatIfCase = true and AlgorithmInput.parentId is equal to the original algorithmInput.id. 

This is added to SDS section 4 and example.doc


>> Please explain the concept of rolling up country data to continent level.
>>The explanation provided by the client and me would suffice, but please add it to avoid later confusion.

Have added this to SDS glossary section.


>> It's not clear for me overall workflow with Expressions and JEXL.......

See updated section 2.7 in backend spec.


>> The admin algorithm configuration seems not trivial and I believe should have a module

No separate module, but this is now part of the front-end module. The added service methods are part of back-end module.


>>ReportExporter and PredictionAlgorithm do not belong to the frontend module. ..........

Fixed. Now in back-end


>>I think you need to provide some guide how to implement new algorithm and how to integrate it with the system....

See example.doc


>> Please define how different instances of algorithms, in particular what if cases, are connected.

Have added algorithmInputId:long to AlgorithmOutput. This connects the AlgorithmOutput to the AlgorithmInput
Have added parentId:long to AlgorithmInput. This connects a what-if case to its original algorithmInput


>>Shouldn't what if scenarios have an entity?

Still using AlgorithmInput. In the what-if case, the AlgorithmInput.isWhatIfCase = true and AlgorithmInput.parentId is equal to the original algorithmInput.id. 


>>You missed the Bluepages security integration.
>>Please add a note on it in the frontend module specification.

Added.


>>Some chosen technologies (Spring, memcached, json-simple, iText) have not been approved in this thread

Spring, memcached are still open. json-simple is allowed. iText is replaced by PDFBox


>>You need to explain why do you need JEXP in SDS for client.
>>Please add your arguments regarding Spring usage in SDS as well. (it was required in the forum)

Added in SDS 7.2.6


>>As Algo could work on multi mb data sets, it'll several seconds or maybe even minutes to finish it work.
>>I think user shouldn't be blocked during this time.
>>It will be cool to add ProcessStatus service and appropriate Progress bar in frontend.

Added and explained in 2.8 PredictionAlgorithm of back-end arch.


>> Should service put predictive algo output to cache as well?
>>For example if user will send same algo input several times. I think such requests should be processed by algo only once and then be retrieved from cache. 

Have added this requirement in 2.5 AlgorithmOutputService of back-end arch.


>>Section 2 from ADS suggests that there will be 3 modules which is not accurate

Corrected


>>SDS section 5.19 and 6.3 - I believe that you should confirm if audit is needed or not.

Confirmed. It is not required


>>As I stated above, please change API to meet requirement 4.4.25.

As stated above, this is simple to change later on. And its is not in scope now.


>> I strongly suggest to add progress bar functionality.

Have added the aync algorithm running capability. Have added thsi requiremnt in front-end arch.


>>Please include a sequence diagram for the management of what if screnarios.

what if screnarios is simply an algorithm input. Hence it is covered by the existing SD


>>Please include a sequence diagram for the configuration of an algorithm.

Please see example.doc. I think it is explained well enough here to not duplicate it with an SD.
