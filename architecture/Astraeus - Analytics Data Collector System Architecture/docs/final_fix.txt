>>According to the scorecard, Logical architecture is more about tiering. 

Added color coding for tiering in diagram

>>Auditing seems not to be covered. In SDS section 5.17 there is this: "The AuditService service will be used to perform >>auditing." but there is no AuditService in the TCUML.

>> "Each Client can have multiple schemas but only one can be active at any moment."
>>This seems not a valid assumption....

This is fixed. Only one can be the default schema but client can now explicitly send the schema_id in request. Updated logic in real-time server spec 2.1 as well

>>roles are gain from LDAP,

Now the AuthService.login method return UserAuth which encapsulates roles. Updated SDS 6.2

>>For conceptualization doc 4.4.12 View Application Settings and 4.4.13 Modify Application Settings,

There already is API for cleint, schema, key. Have mentioned this specfically now in Admin Nodule Spec 2.5. I am not sure what other application settings are required.

>>There is no much details for the server module.
>>These details may better to provided or suggested:

>>See http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=768318&start=0,
>>you should provide or suggest details of exposing Analytics Data for external tools.

Database details for Cassandra are already suggested in SDS sec 4
The real-time data model is already provided in SDS sec 4. 
The data model used to store the archival data is completely up to the module architect.
The analytics data is now exposed over HTTP. See section 2.3 in both server modules spec

>>If so why the rememberMe parameter is passed into to the AuthService.login() which does not have any access to the cookie.
Removed

>>You didn't always check whether the auth session key are valid. Only invalidating session key seems not sufficient for logout.
I have removed the AuthService.logout. The front-end controller will deal with logout, See updated SDS 5.2

>>As per the BRD 4.4.10, the developer documentation are about how to use the JavaScript library. So I believe the SDS is wrong for this section.
Added for both Java and JavaScript.

>>It would be better to use 2xx and 5xx since the status codes have different meaning. In addition, 3xx and 4xx are often used as well.
Was already there. Have added note to point to the defined error conditions.

>>For the AuthService, I don't think the "remember me" can be or should be........
Duplicate

>> For the Tracking Info Migrator, it is not clear what technology is used for periodic scheduling. CRON, Quartz, or other technology ?
Fixed. Uses cron.

>> I believe the "Astraeus Analytics Server Module" should be split to at least two module since there are quite ....
Fixed

>>The client_schema and client_schema_keys should better be merged into a single table (ColumnFamily) since the data are actually always used together and the NoSQL database does not JOIN.  You can even think of using SuperColumn

Not fixing this because it was Rejected :) (by mistake?)
Anyway I think it will just mean that we will need 2 calls instead of 1 for getting the data. No need for join.

>>In SDS 4, both client_schema table and client_schema_keys table contain key and key_description columns, these are confusing.

Fixed

>> In SDS 5.17: "The AuditService service will be used to perform auditing." but the AuditService is not defined.

Added

>> In SDS 7.6: "See section 5.1.6", there is no section 5.1.6, it should be 5.16.

Fixed

>>You need to provide the Initial Setup Assembly (sometimes for PoC), and final integration assembly.

Provided

>>The Astraeus Analytics Server Module should include functionalities to publish collected analytics data for consumption by external reporting tools.
>>The Astraeus Analytics - Server Module.rtf doesn't mention such details.

The analytics data is now exposed over HTTP. See section 2.3 in both server modules spec

>>The relationships from Client to Schema, and from Schema to Key, are aggregations, not compositions.

-------------------------------------------FINAL FIX 2-------------------------------------------

1. Added requirement in SDS 5.6 for the JavaScript and API demo
2. The Access Published Real-time data SD was already there. I have added Access Published Batch data SD. Earlier it was just a comment in the real-time data SD.
