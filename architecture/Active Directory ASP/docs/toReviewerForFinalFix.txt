1. Arbitrarily complex objects are now supported using recursion.
2. GetUserEntryByUserName searcher by userName for the given application Name, so all methods calling thsi method are taking care of the application name.
3. AleaActaEst 4.1.7.2: Actually I am using Wordpad which is allowed as per design guidelines. The CS looks ok in Wordpad.
4. AleaActaEst 4.1.7.3: Actually even RS does not specify version for LDAP and AD, so I'm leavin this out.
5. I have included a prototype which contains complete recursive code used for the Set/Get propertyValues methods.
6. Existing SDs have been updated. The new Get/Set PropertyRecursively methods are candidates for SD too, but considering that I have provided an already functional code for these methods, the SDs for these does not seem necessary.

Thanks for your review,
