Here is an email exchange with copilot:

kurtrips:
Please take a look at the responses in nikolay83's review. There are 2 issues:
1. Blogging support - You have confirmed that the only requirement is that added content should be available as a list on a page. This is already present in Joomla, in fact this is the home page.
2. Load Balancing Test Scenario - Architecture contests are not responsible for test definition or test strategy.

cyberjag:
1. Please add a new page for blogs that can support commenting for logged in users. Also if possible tagging should be supported.
2. Load testing is not required as we are planning to do it as a separate task.

nikolay83 1.1.4 - user posts as a list is already available. Comments and Tags are added. See last para of SDS section 5.3

nikolay83 1.1.5.1 - As per http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Message&messageID=1562880, it seems the only things required are user preferences and user profile page. See updated SDS section 5.5

nikolay83 1.1.5.2 - Not fixing this. Suggested JCron class is an extension and it is not available for Joomla 2.5. See http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/administration/admin-performance/847 I think a normal cron is enough here as this is just a test leaderboard component.

nikolay83 1.1.5.3 - Fixed in SDS section 7.4

nikolay83 1.1.5.3 - Fixed in SDS section 7.7

nikolay83 2.3.2 - This is not required as per copilot response in email
