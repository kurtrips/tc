Hello flying2hk,

Hi, I have not fixed Question 4.1.4-2 "Please use "Combined Fragment Alt" or "Combined Fragment Opt" to represent
if-else/if block."

I dont think this is a TC baselined rule as still most designs use colored rectangles instead of Combined Fragment for showing if-else blocks.
Hope you are ok with this.

Thanks nad Regards.
