There are some changes to the algorithms in accordance with the latest forum thread discussions

-------------------------------------------------
Schpotsky:

>>The actual active worker count should be stored/accessed using ConfigurationPersistenceService : http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=764727&start=0 
Fixed

>>"Run the data feed processing from command line" should be removed , since the DataIngestionApplication is not in scope of this component.
Removed

>>The documentation is missing  for Excecutor constructor. 
Fixed

>>Executor, DataIngestionWatcher, HeartbeatMonitorService, FeedMonitorService methods should throw a custom exception when some error occurred during processing.
Fixed. We need to rollback in case of errors, so the exception strategy is slightly more complicated than just throwing exceptions.
Please see the docs in TCUML of FeedMonitorServiceImpl.start, HeartbeatMonitorServiceImpl.start, DataIngestionWatcherImpl.process and DataIngestionWorker.run. Executor simply bubbles the exceptions through.

>>Sample Spring configuration file is required to be provided.
Added in CS 3.3

>>Section "1 . Design" should provide a high level description of this component. (the provided functionality and interfaces/classes defined in this component).
Done see section 1

>>DataIngestionApplication is not in scope of this component, it should be removed from the Class diagram and the CS. 
Fixed

------------------------------------------------

bramandia:

>> CS 1.3.2. I think step vii needs to be done before step vi.
I assume you mean CS 1.3.3. This is appealed at http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=765408&start=0
However there is some other change in the order. Please check it.

>>FeedMonitorService and HeartbeatMonitorService are strategy. FeedMonitorServiceImpl and HeartbeatMonitorServiceImpl are the impl. 
Fixed

>> I think it is beneficial to create DataNode class. 
Done

>>logger should be static 
fixed

>>I think separate exception should be defined to cover cases where there is parsing error in the input file.
Not using a separate exception but it is now covered. See doc of FeedMonitorServiceImpl.start

>>Missing doc for Executor#constructor. 
Fixed

>>DataIngestionWOrker#nodeData should say if empty string is allowed.
No longer using string

-------------------------------------------------------

fastprogrammer:

>>The use-cases for Heartbeat monitor service is missed being mentioned.
Fixed.

>>DataIngestionWatcher does not need the process() method to be shown as it is extending from Watcher interface which anyways defines the method.
Not sure why not. This is recommended anyway so not fixed.

>>DataIngestionApplication is not in the scope of this contest and needs to be removed from this design.
Duplicate

>>+istLooping():boolean -> isLooping
Fixed

>> In "Data Ingestion Sequence Diagram", the setAlive() calls are missed being shown.
Data Ingestion Sequence Diagram is now removed

>>Zookeper -> Zookeeper
Fixed

>>There are lot of criss-crossing lines in the class diagram and its better to adjust the classes so as to avoid the criss-crossing of the lines
Not fixing this. This should really be recommended.

>>Section 1 of the CS doc. should describe on the classes present in the design.
