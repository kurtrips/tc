http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=771983&start=0&mc=3#1649739
All user info should be compared. 

Fixed

>>Please export the pdf & word documents' content into plain text files first,
and then load the data from the plain text files.
We want this flexibility in case the pdf/word parsing fails in the future, then we can create the plain text files manually.
(no point taken). 

Fixed

>>Flexibility requirement for data processing is not covered. A pluggable approach is needed.

Introduced the interfaces.

>>Configuration was not addressed at all, but there is a must to achieve flexibility on the data processing. The configuration is a major requirement.

Updated. The interfaces are now initalized using their class names from proeprties file.

>>Matching of parsed master file with the data from parsed input reference files is not covered. Major issue.

See ADS 1.5

>>Writing output report file and the format of that file is not covered. Major issue.

See ADS 1.5
Format of final output file is not defined formally. But it is evident from the comparison logic in ADS 1.5

>>The chapter "2.4 Logging" of the submission doesn't cover those issues are all. Sorry, but very major logging requirement is missed here.

Added note as per http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=772658&start=0

>>external components missed: log4j, apache poi, pdfbox. - the related section is needed, not just deployment constraints.

added

>>Assembly specs should be clear on the following requirements:
“We will need desktop application installation directions including which software we need on our machines, and how to install it.”
“We will also need directions if we need to build or compile the tool at all.”

Added this to GUI AS

>>Performance issues

Left as is as per forum discussion

>>MiG-29 3.1.2 spelling mistakes

Some are fixed, some i cannot find
UID and GRP need not be defined. They are constants from the Word doc dataset table

>> Colors on assembly and sequence diagrams are wrong.

Fixed. And also fixed the SD


Other items are duplicates IMO
