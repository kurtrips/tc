Final Fix 2:

Red Hat Linux is now added to ADS and specs
changlog error is fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I have refactored a the architecture into a front-end and a back-end one, keeping in mind the discussion at http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=774387&start=0
The MarathonMatchInfoService is new. It is solely responsible for the data access.
The actions are now merged into one assembly.

I have updated the assembly specs, each relevant section in ADS, the dependency diagram, the SDs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>New URL pattern for tracking Marathon Matches was NOT defined. It should have round ID as a part of URL.

Added to the description of each action

>>API for retrieving data from each chart was not provided.

It is not required. But I have introduced a new data-access layer (see MarathonMatchInfoService) which can be used later for the REST service (as per discussion at http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=774387&start=0)

>>The requirement form wiki was: "HighCharts is used for client side chart rendering, your solution should provide APIs to retrieve data from each chart" but I do not see a formalized API being exposed.

Duplicate

>>formatting data and rendering charts SD is absent.

Added. See Prepare JSON and Bind data to charts Sequence Diagram

>> the workflow for formatting data and rendering them on the charts is absent. It was a requirement: http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=773490&start=0 ...

appealed.

>>Data entities should be thoroughly explained with code for each field and methods explained for the developers.,.

They are documented now. See TCUML entity, fields documenation.
The data source is already there in the assemblies.

>> In section "2.3 Threading" we have: "The JBoss Web Server will serve each web request with a separate instance of the Struts action. Therefore it need not be thread-safe" but how does this prevent threading issues with the back-end?

Added more info to ADS 2.3

>>"There are no specific concurrency concerns as data is only being read and not written."
- what about other processes writing the data? After all the data must be written at some point, how is that prevented form messing up our component?

Added more info to ADS 2.4

>> "If any required configuration parameter is missed, then we will throw new IllegalStateException to denote the error situation." ---> why not have a configuration exception? You can easily do that with Spring.

Recommended item not fixed.

>> "All persistence access will be done using queries."
- what kind of queries? Be specific.

Fixed in ADS 2.6

>>"If query string parameters are missing or invalid or no entity is found for their given values, then we will throw the IllegalArgumentException."
- why would you throw IllegalArgumentException if the return number of entities is 0?

Recommended item not fixed.

>>"JSON will be built programatically by the actions. It will be done using the Jackson library. " ---> which version of the library?

1.9.7. Have added this to ADS and specs and dependency diagram.

>>Scalability was not addressed. An entire section is absent in ADS.

Added section to ADS.

>>ADS does not properly define what the scope of the architecture is. It states: "This project goals is to move and integrates the tracking functionality for Marathon Match into this platform." but this does not tell anything about what this will do.

Added a new para to ADS 1.

>>In the ADS the workflow should talk about how the integration will affect the behavior of the cockpit and to give a higher-level overview of what this project will do and how the users will use it.

The higher-level overview is added in ADS 1.
Not sure what else I can add to the workflow section. It already is quite clear and descriptive.

>>Q3.1.2 spelling errors
>>Q3.1.3 spelling errors

All fixed. Did not find changlog

>>Q3.2.1 SD issues
All fixed. One new SD introduced to elaborate on the JSON and data binding part.

>> Descriptions of classes, methods, and fields are needed in TCUML, because this is a direct to assembly contest.
Not needed as per copilot response at http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=774392&start=0

There are some other issues but they are duplicates.
