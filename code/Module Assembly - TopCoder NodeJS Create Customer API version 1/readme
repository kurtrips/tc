1.
The statements in time_oltp_data_setup.sql contains the sequences and data setup statements that need to be added to 
https://coder.topcoder.com/internal/database/scripts/trunk/time_oltp/02_time_oltp_data_setup.sql

The unique contsraint on client.customer_number is included but is commented out because there are currently rows which violate the data.

2.
There are also audit tables for client, address and contact which are client_audit, address_audit and contact_audit respectively.
I am not writing to these tables as there are existing triggers which insert into these tables when data is added to the main table.
However the tests do check whether the data is added properly to these tables and that only one row exists (there would be 2 if we inserted the data ourselves)
