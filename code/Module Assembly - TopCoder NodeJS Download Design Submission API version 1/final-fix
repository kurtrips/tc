anyway this recommended, so fix is not required. moreover I am somewhat sure that the logic is correct

>>has_access_to_project_as_directproject_member is incorrect, you've checked the billing project of contest against associated_direct_projects, it's incorrect.

>>mine_types and file_types are constants, so you don't need to read it in every request, we can hard code them in js just like image type ids.
Not fixing this. I missed this in appeals phase.
There are 31 mime types and 45 file types. It is too much to hard-code all of these in code. 
A better solution would be to add caching to these lookup entities in code, but I digress. Anyway this should be recommended.

>>you've check everyone permission at last, you should move it before cockpit permissions checking, then we can improve the performance as we don't need to run query to check cockpit permission if user already meet everyone permission.
fixed

>>you can add a method for below code to avoid code redundancy.
again. this should be recommended.
I actually tried this but it made the code look more confusing at the expense of some lines of code.
So i reverted back to the original state
