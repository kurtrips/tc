As described in http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=812707&start=0
The folder already consists 2 zips, one for full submissions and one for preview
The preview zip is basically the submission file minus the sources.
There are also extracted and watermarked files in this folder

So depending on the request, we need to directly serve either the full zip or the preview zip or individual files.
There is no need to actuall look inside a zip folder and extract the needed content.

2.
Design submissions always have zip format (both the full and preview submission)
See https://coder.topcoder.com/internal/web_module/trunk/src/main/com/topcoder/web/studio/controller/request/Submit.java, where the zip is created in code
So there is no need to test any other formats such tar.gz, 7z etc.
