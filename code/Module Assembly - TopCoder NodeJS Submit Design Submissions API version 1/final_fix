>>processFontData method:
>>in Submit.java, it will collect as many as errors possible, however, you return with the first error

Not fixing this. it is too ugly. Please also see http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=813963&start=0&mc=1#1858370


>>you didn't check whether sourceFile(connection.params.sourceFile) is type of file before calling 

fixed for all.


>>The entry names 'source' and 'submission' should be configurable according to the implementation of Submit.java.

fixed


>>The clear db script is not correct, it can not clean all the test data.
This is fixed.
Please see http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=813963&start=0&mc=1#1858370
You might want to fix the sequence on your VM.


>>'User not a Submitter for the challenge' can not been re-produced fully.
>>If no data is uploaded by that user, the output json will be:
>>"error": "Error: submissionFile is a required parameter for this action",

This is something inherent in actionhero. If a required parmeter is missing, it will straight away return and that too (incorrectly) with a 200 response code!!
This has been discussed in many contests. We cannot fix this unless we change actionhero itself.


>>filePath = api.config.designSubmissionsBasePath + challengeId + "/" + userHandle + "_" + userId + "/";
>>The 'userHandle' should be 'userHandle.toLowerCase()'

Fixed.


>>The java code UnifiedSubmissionValidator.validate is NOT implemented in nodejs

Not fixing this. I had already mentioned this in the readme.

>>method generateUnifiedSubmissionFile:
>>please use async.waterfall to process, otherwise the done callback method may be called more than once

Fixed. Please see the fix. Note that Javascript is single threaded, so there are no thread safety concerns for the doneCalled variable to be changed simultaneously.


>>When running the test cases for the first time, one test will fail, here is the log:
>>1) Submit for design challenge "after all" hook
Duplicate


>>Submit Checkpoint Submission scenario........
fixed

>>please remove '.~lock.Module Assembly - Topcoder NodeJS Challenge Results.doc#' in submission under docs
fixed

>>missing topcoder header/footer and page number in each page
this is most probably because of inconsistent behavior between your and mine Word processors.
Anyway I am including a PDF, where you can see that the page headers footers and numbers are shown
