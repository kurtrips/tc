1. As discussed in forum, there is a bug in actionhero for arrays parameters in multipart request. So the || delimited values are being used.
This is already confirmed with copilot

2. I am using 3 new libraries: adm-zip for reading zip files, mkdirp for recursively creating direectories like the Java mkdirs, archiver for writing zip files.
adm-zip cannot be used for writing as it's writing functions fail.

3. some queries are being reused such as insert_submission, insert_upload etc. They are not included in the submission.
existing submission and upload sequences are being reused but they are included in the db-scripts in case they do not already exist in your VM.

4. In the current code there is a validation after creating the unified zip using UnifiedSubmissionValidator
This is completely redundant.
The individual validators using SourceSubmissionValidator and ImageSubmissionValidator already check most of the same thing.
And the way that generateUnifiedSubmissionFile is created, the submission and source folder is always created.
So the UnifiedSubmissionValidator cannot fail after this. Hence this piece is left out in my submission.

5. adm-zip is synchronous in nature, so the code in generateUnifiedSubmissionFile method uses some synchronous fs operations as well.
Other than this no other synchronous methods are used anywhere.
