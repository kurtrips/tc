1. In thread http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=575422&start=0&mc=3,
designer has given free hand to move code from CreateChildControls to Constructor and vice-versa.
Due to the issues i have mentioned in the thread, all code was moved from CreateChildControls to constructor. As a result CreateChildControls was left empty. So i have removed it as an empty function was not serving any function.
Kindly do not mark me down for this.

2. Similar case is for Page_Load. Though this function is still present but the implementation is different from what designer suggested as it was not possible to implement it that way.
Kindly do not mark me down for this also.

Thanks
