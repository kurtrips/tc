1. This delivery is packaged with the Mobile XML Signature COmponent. Only 3 extra files have been    added to the project. They are
  (i)   src\csharp\main\TopCoder\Security\Cryptography\Mobile\Digesters\SHA256Digester.cs
  (ii)  src\csharp\tests\TopCoder\Security\Cryptography\Mobile\DefaultSHA256DigesterTests.cs
  (iii) src\csharp\tests\TopCoder\Security\Cryptography\Mobile\SignatureManagerUsingSHA256Tests.cs

2. The test case DefaultSHA256DigesterTests runs official NIST SHA byte oriented test cases       available from here http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/shs.htm. These are present in test_files folder as SHA256LongMsg.txt and SHA256ShortMsg.txt

3. The nant test takes an awfully long to run. About 120 seconds on my machine. Please be    patient. The tests also need to connect to the web.

Thanks
