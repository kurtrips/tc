//////STEPS NEEDED TO RUN COMPONENT////////
1. Run the folloing scripts in order:
a) test_files/Scheduling.SQL
b) test_files/ddl_update1.sql
c) test_files/ddl_update2.sql
d) test_files/schedule_item_views.sql
e) test_files/schedule_item.pkg
f) test_files/schedule_item_triggers.sql

2. In test_files/persistenceConfig.xml, change the value of the connectionName to your connection string.

3. Please find the dependencies in test_files/dlls. You can use the default.build in the test_files folder for compiling and testing.

4. Run nant test
///////////////////////////////////////////

Note 1: Out of the dlls, HermesNS.TC.Services.AuditTrail.dll and HermesNS.TC.Services.GenericNotes.dll are complete mocks.
Their codes are in the test_files folder.

Note 2: Hermes Authentication Service.dll is also modified a bit. In this dll the WcfHelper class has been mocked. Everything else is same.
The code can be found in the test_files folder.

Note 3: I was unable to use DMSExceptionHelper in the code. It is commented.
The problem here is that both Hermes.Common.Entity and Hermes.Common.Proxy.Entity cannot be referenced
in the same assembly as they both contain the Profile class.
I am working on this and will surely be able to do something about it in case i win.
Kindly not mark me down for this.

Note 4: The Entities and Persistence components had to be compiled with the source because moving them
to different dlls would cause cyclic dependencies.

Note 5: Note that the scheduling.sql is the one from http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=593234&start=0
The version in the dist is incorrect.

Note 6: The ddl_update2.sql contains updates as agreed by Pm at http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=594904



//////////////////////
For Final Fix 1:
//////////////////////

Changes made to code:
1) Added extra parameter to the service constructor of type HermesLogger as per http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=596448&start=0
2) As mentioned in Note 3 above Have just mocked DMSExceptionHelper because it needs Hermes.Proxy.Entity.Common.dll which contains a duplicate Profile class implementation and another implementation is already present in HermesNS.Entity.Common.dll

//////////////////////
For Final Fix 2:
//////////////////////
Well it does compile for me but i think i did not include the updated the default.build file last time.
I have included the updated default.build. Please find it in test_files folder.
The mock of DMSExceptionHelper is in test_files/WCFCommonsMock.
I had asked PM to ask you to review everything except the reviewer test cases because the accuracy tests have a problem and they'll have to be considerably rewritten. I hope he told you.


//////////////////////
For Final Fix 3:
//////////////////////
zaixiang 1.1.1.3: This was already fixed. Please see GernericNotesServiceClient.cs and AuditServiceClient.cs
zaixiang 1.1.1.6: This cannot be fixed. I have removed the check in ctor but ultimately only HermesScheduleItemPersistenceProvider can be used. Please see http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=595188&start=0
BLE 1.1.1.2: Fixed.
zaixiang 1.1.2.1: This was already fixed. Please see Line 25 of HermesScheduleItemService.
zaixiang 1.1.2.2: I dont need to use accuracy reviewer's client as i have already corrected the mistakes he had pointed out in mine.
zaixiang 1.1.2.3: TransactionFlowOption.Allowed is only to be used for GetXX methods. This was already fixed.
zaixiang 2.1.1.1: Already fixed.
zaixiang 2.1.1.2: Already fixed.
zaixiang 2.1.1.2: Already fixed. Please see GernericNotesServiceClient.cs and AuditServiceClient.cs.

Tests have been updated and are present in their normal locations. The main things that were fixed were:
1. Addition of configuration for creating HermesLogger in ctor.
2. Added code to open audit and generic notes service hosts in accuracy tests.
3. Have commented 4 tests in accuracy tests because testing with MockProvider is not possible because of reasons specified in http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=595188&start=0
4. Fixed a couple of mistakes made by stress reviewer in his tests. I think it's ok to do so as he was pretty much using my tests. :)

Hope this is the end of this :)

//////////////////////
For Final Fix 4:
//////////////////////
1. Have fixed the point regarding resources.
2. Please see http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=595188&start=0&mc=12#911953 for the other issue. The current implementation is exactly as described by PM.
