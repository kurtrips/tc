1)
Mocks have been compiled to Astraea.Inframap.Data.dll and TopCoder.Graph.Layout.dll.
These are present in test_files/dlls folder along with all other dll needed for this component.

2)
The source for the Astraea.Inframap.Data.dll and TopCoder.Graph.Layout.dll mocks is present in the test_files folder.



FOR FINAL FIX 1:

Changes made to ACCURACY tests:
1) Changed the "TestGraphLayouterToken/type_name" config property from TopCoder.Graph.Layout.Layouter.TimeFocussedLayouter to
TopCoder.Graph.Layout.Layouter.MockLayouter in the accuracy test config file. I think this can be done without loss of generality.

2) Changed lines 166, 177, 188, 198 in LayoutEngineAccuracyTests class from
Assert.AreEqual("1000", link1.Attributes[0].Name, "The original link attributes should be copied.");
to Assert.AreEqual("origLinkId", link1.Attributes[0].Name, "The original link attributes should be copied.");
This is as per the changes requested by PM in forum.

3) LayoutEngineAccuracyTests lines 97,106,115:
Removed 669+i to 669, because as long as new nodes are not added to the mapdata, GenerateUniqueId must return the same new id.


The updated files are presnet in the respective folders at the normal locations.



FOR FINAL FIX 2:
Fixed issues as per forum thread. Some accuracy and stress tests will need to be changed for this.



FOR FINAL FIX 3:
Changes made to accuracy tests: See note for Final Fix 1.
Changes made to stress tests: Loading of config files moved from preload.xml to Setup and TearDown functions.
Changed some of my own tests too.

Please find the updated tests and their test files in the respective folders at the normal locations.



FOR FINAL FIX 4:

Reviewer Response: Your submission didn't:
copy the attributes of the original link to these links, create a new attribute to store the original link id, and remove the original link.

Fixed as per PM suggestion.


Reviewer Response: BaseLayoutEngine#GenerateLastUsedUniqueIds:
the algo is wrong. you should clac new max id but not use cached one
since the passed mapdatas may be different.

This was already fixed. PLease contact PM if there are any issues.


3.1.1- Reviewer Response: private method can be declared as static
e.g. LayoutEngine#
private void CreateLabelsForNonSyntheticNodes(MapData mapdata)

This is not possible as it uses DefaultFontSize, CharacterUnits which are non static entities.
